# Analyze and Present A/B Test Results

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, "average bidding”, as an alternative to its exisiting bidding type, called maximum bidding”.

One of our clients, bombabomba.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding.

In this A/B test, bombabomba.com randomly splits its audience into two equally sized groups, e.g. the test and the control group.

A Facebook ad campaign with “maximum bidding” is served to “control group” and another campaign with “average bidding” is served to the “test group”.

The A/B test run for 1 month and bombabomba.com now expects you to analyze and present the results of this A/B test.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Company names are all fictitious, this study case is just a scenario.**

**You should answer the following questions in your presentation:**

1. How would you define the hypothesis of this A/B test?
2. Can we conclude statistically significant results?
3. Which statistical test did you use, and why ?
4. Based on your answer to Question 2, what would be your recommendation to client?
